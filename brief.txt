1. Task Queue Management
============================
i have designed the task queue system using BullMQ, a powerful and flexible job and task queue library that integrates seamlessly with Redis. The queue system ensures efficient management of background tasks by decoupling task submission from task processing.

Why BullMQ?
================================
Reliability: BullMQ is built on top of Redis, a robust, fast, and scalable in-memory data structure store.
Features: It supports job retries, delayed jobs, and scheduling, all of which are crucial for managing background tasks in a production environment.
Scalability: BullMQ can handle high throughput and large volumes of tasks with minimal configuration, making it suitable for enterprise-level applications.

2. Task Queue Design
=====================
The queue system includes two main components:

API Endpoints: Accept tasks and place them into the queue.
Worker Logic: Processes the tasks from the queue asynchronously.
Why this structure?
Separation of Concerns: The API only handles accepting and adding tasks, while the worker is responsible for task processing. This helps in maintaining a clean and scalable architecture.
Async Task Processing: Tasks are processed asynchronously, which prevents blocking the main application thread and allows for better performance and scalability.



3. Task Handling and Response Structure
=============================================
When a task is successfully added to the queue, the API responds with a status message and the job.id.

Why Include job.id?
Tracking and Auditing: The job.id allows both the system and the users to track and audit tasks throughout their lifecycle, from creation to completion or failure.
Job Management: The unique job.id is essential for querying job statuses, logging, or interacting with tasks via additional API endpoints.
